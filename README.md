This project allows the user to draw on a pixelated grid, much like the famous childhood toy called Etch-A-Sketch. Mouse hovering over the active screen will change the color of the pixels, allowing the user to draw basic patterns and shapes. Hitting the clear button will reset the screen and allow users to start again.

README.md contains information about the project.
index.html contains the html elements and links to the stylesheet and script.
styles.css contains css elements that are important for design.
javascript.js contains code that makes the drawing screen work.

This project demonstrates my proficiency with building a user interface using HTML and CSS and making it interactive using javascript. This project also showing my continued proficiency with Git, GitHub and problem solving.
